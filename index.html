            <p style="text-align: center;">
              I am Abhitej, a high schooler living in NJ. I started programming by learning HTML and Javascript 
              in 2018, and have enjoyed occasionally making projects.

              This website is not meant to provide anything holistic about me and my experience, it is simply a 
              directory to keep links and information about my favorite projects.

                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">
                      This is a java program that uses a maze-generation algorithm in order to generate a maze. I added colors because I thought it looked cool, although they would not be in an actual generated maze.
                      <br>The algorithm is based off of a pointer, which randomly moves through a grid without doubling back, and creates a path wherever it moves. When the pointer gets stuck, it moves backward until there is a new place to move.

                    <h1>Wave Function Collapse</h1>
                    <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                      The wave function collapse algorithm is inspired by quantum mechanicsm, specifically superpositions and collapses. Each tile has a set of possibilities it can take up, and a number of rules dictating how the tiles can be placed in relation to each other. One tile is collapsed at random, by evaluating its state from the possibilities; the algorithm will then collapse the tile with the least possible states under the rules. This will continue until the entire grid is collapse.
                      <br>This algorithm creates a grid of tiles with blue and green ends, with the rule that blue ends must connect to blue ends, and green ends must connect to green ends.

                    <br> This is an animation I built for a school halloween java design contest, and it was voted as the best project of the class.
                    <br> This project is not hosted on the web, and must be downloaded in order to be run. However, I included a video recording of the animation.
